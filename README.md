# NexaTask

NexaTask is a lightweight internal task and workflow management system built with **vanilla JavaScript**.

This project simulates a **real corporate product environment**, following agile practices, product ownership, and iterative development — with the goal of strengthening JavaScript fundamentals through a production-style codebase.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The main objectives of this project are:

- Practice **modern JavaScript (ES6+)** in a real-world scenario
- Learn how to structure a frontend project without frameworks
- Simulate a **corporate agile workflow** (Scrum-inspired)
- Build features incrementally, as in a real product team

This is **not a tutorial project**, but a hands-on simulation of professional frontend development.

---

## 🏢 Product Overview

NexaTask is designed for internal use by small and mid-size teams to:

- Create and manage tasks
- Track progress through workflow stages
- Assign responsibilities
- Maintain a clear overview of team work

The initial version focuses on core functionality and usability rather than visual polish.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- LocalStorage (temporary persistence, simulating a backend)

No frameworks are used in the initial phase to reinforce core JavaScript concepts.
